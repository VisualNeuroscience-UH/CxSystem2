4 - Using neurodynlib
=====================

Neurodynlib tutorials are composed as Jupyter Notebooks. You can find the notebooks in
`the Brain Simulation Platform <https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/67332/nav/457373>`_. If you want to
play around with the models, copy the notebooks to your own collab.

If you have installed CxSystem2 locally, the tutorial notebooks are also available in the :code:`cxsystem2.neurodynlib`
submodule under the folder *tutorial*. In the terminal, write

.. code-block:: console

    cd /path_to_CxSystem2/cxsystem2/neurodynlib/tutorial/
    jupyter notebook

If you don't have jupyter, you can install it by typing :code:`pip install jupyter`.
