Using the BSP interface
=======================

CxSystem2 can be used on the Human Brain Project
`Brain Simulation Platform (BSP) <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/brain-simulation/brain-simulation-platform/>`_,
which is a collaborative web platform designed for reconstruction and simulation of brain models.
To use CxSystem2 on the BSP, you only need an account for the BSP and a compatible web browser (Firefox or Chrome).
`This link provides information on acquiring an account to the BSP <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/hbp-platforms/getting-access/>`_.

After you have used CxSystem2 on the BSP and want to use it for more complex simulations, we recommend that you
:ref:`install it locally <installation>`.
