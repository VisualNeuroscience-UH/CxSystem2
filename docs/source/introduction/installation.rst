Installing locally
==================

CxSystem2 can be installed locally using *pip*. The local version allows running simulations via a browser
user interface (BUI) or from command line. Simulations can also be sent via ssh to clusters that use the SLURM workload manager.

To install CxSystem2, please follow the instructions on
`our GitHub page <https://github.com/VisualNeuroscience-UH/CxSystem2>`_.
