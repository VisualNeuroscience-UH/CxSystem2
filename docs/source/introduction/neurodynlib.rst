Neurodynlib
===========

Neurodynlib is a submodule that contains all the point neuron models included in CxSystem2. It can be used independently of CxSystem2,
for example, inside a Jupyter notebook to explore the behaviour of single neuron models or small networks.
Neurodynlib grew out of the need to understand the behaviour of neuron models before incorporating them
into a larger network.

Neurodynlib is based on the exercise 'code repository <http://github.com/EPFL-LCN/neuronaldynamics-exercises>' accompanying the book
`Neuronal Dynamics <http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch>`_.

The book is also published in print:
Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud, and Liam Paninski.
