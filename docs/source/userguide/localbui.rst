Running the BUI locally
=======================

You can run CxSystem2 as a local server similar to the Jupyter notebook server.
This allows you to use the browser user interface (BUI) to run simulations locally or
launch jobs on a remote cluster.

Please read the instructions on :ref:`installing CxSystem2 locally <installation>` and on using
:ref:`the cxserver command <cxserver>`.
