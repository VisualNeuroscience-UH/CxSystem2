CxSystem2
=========
CxSystem2 is a simulator for biomimetic spiking network models of cortical circuits. It is implemented in Python
on top of the popular `Brian2 simulator <https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_, and runs on Linux,
Windows and MacOS. There is also a :ref:`web-based version <usingbsp>` available via
the Human Brain Projectâ€™s `Brain Simulation Platform (BSP) <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/brain-simulation/brain-simulation-platform/>`_.

CxSystem2 embraces the main goal of Brian -- minimizing development time -- by providing the user with
a simplified interface. While many simple models can be written in pure Brian code, more complex models can get
hard to manage due to the large number of biological details involved.

We currently provide two interfaces for constructing networks: a browser-based interface (locally or via the BSP),
and a comma-separated (csv) file-based interface. Before incorporating neuron models into a network,
the user can explore their behavior using the neurodynlib<link> submodule. Spike output of network simulations can be
visualized using `ViSimpl <http://gmrv.es/gmrvvis/visimpl/>`_, a visualization tool developed by the
`GMRV Lab <http://gmrv.es/gmrvvis/>`_.

More information on our motivation is available `here <https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/files/126265396/Andalibi_2019_NECO.pdf>`_.
We have used the simulator to construct `a simplified version of a comprehensive cortical microcircuit
<https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/files/126265461/Hokkanen_2019_NECO.pdf>`_.

The preliminary version of CxSystem2 was developed at `Aalto University <https://www.aalto.fi/en>`_, Finland, in 2012-2015, and
the current version at the `University of Helsinki <https://www.helsinki.fi/en>`_, Finland, in 2013-2019.
The software is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL v3.
