# versioning format from Software_Versionin in wiki:
# The followings can be used in the third position:
#
# 0 for alpha (status)
# 1 for beta (status)
# 2 for release candidate
# 3 for (final) release
# For instance:
#
# 1.2.0.1 instead of 1.2-a1
# 1.2.1.2 instead of 1.2-b2 (beta with some bug fixes)
# 1.2.2.3 instead of 1.2-rc3 (release candidate)
# 1.2.3.0 instead of 1.2-r (commercial distribution)
# 1.2.3.5 instead of 1.2-r5 (commercial distribution with many bug fixes)
#
# for instance the new format starts with 0.1.1.1 which means version 0.1 beta with several patches. At final release
# we will move to version 1.0 instead of 0.1
__version__ = "0.1.1.8"
